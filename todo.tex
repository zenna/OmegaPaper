\section{TODO}
\begin{itemize}
\item (writing) put title back to predicate exchange
\item (writing) abstract needs complete revision (and should be shorter)
\item Possibly remove measure theory, write all in terms of â„“?
\item proof of propositon 1
\item (relatedwork) add discussion of PSL (in rebuttal)
\item (relatedwork) add discussion of Replica-exchange MCMC (in rebuttal)
\item fix invg depth diagram
\item fix font-size on gaussian plot (figure 7); it's unreadable 
\item (experiments) add complete experimental setup (e.g. num samples, hyperparameter values)
\item (experiments) add MCMC diagnostics, convergence tests, etc
\item (experiments) Another experiment?
\item (figures) more analysis of dynamics of replica exchange
\item theorem / proof of correctness of replica exchange algorithm
\item expand on naming/ids
\item replace x = normal(x, 0, 1) with x = normal(xid, 0, 1)
\item expand on loops,control-flow with examples
\end{itemize}
