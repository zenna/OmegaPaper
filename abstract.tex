Probabilistic languages allow us to express predicates but due to a lack of tractable likelihoods,  inference procedures are only able to condition on a highly restricted subset of them.
% Models conditioned on predicates rarely have a tractable likelihood and likelihood-free inference methods
% only handle predicates which express observations of data.
To address a broader class of predicates, we develop an inference procedure called \emph{predicate exchange}, which softens predicates.
Soft predicates return values in a continuous Boolean algebra.

Predicate exchange substitutes likeloods with soft predicates using replica exchange -- something in statistical physics -- to mitigate approximations introduced by the softening.

% and are substitutes for the likelihood function in the posterior.

% Softening introduces error; soft predicates approximate their hard counterparts.
% The degree of error can be increased or decreased, which trades off between  a parameterized approximation error which when increased
% To mitigate this trade-off, develop a derivative of replica exchange, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method originating in statistical physics.

We implement predicate exchange through a nonstandard execution of a simulation based model, and provide a light-weight tool that can be supplanted on top of existing probabilistic programming formalisms. 
We demonstrate the approach on sequence models of health and inverse rendering.
