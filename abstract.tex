Programming languages allow us to express complex predicates, but existing inference procedures are unable to condition on most of them.
To address a broader class of predicates, we develop an inference procedure called \emph{predicate exchange}, which softens predicates.
A soft predicate quantifies the extent to which values of latent variables
are consistent with the predicate.
We substitute the likelihood term in the Bayesian posterior with a soft predicate, and develop a variant of replica exchange to draw posterior samples.
We implement predicate exchange through a nonstandard execution of a simulation based model, and provide a light-weight tool that can be supplanted on top of existing probabilistic programming formalisms. 
We demonstrate the approach on sequence models of health and inverse rendering.
