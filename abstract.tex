We develop a likelihood free inference procedure for conditioning a probabilistic model on a predicate.
A predicate is a Boolean valued function which expresses a yes/no question about a domain; when conditioned on, they enforce propositions such as ``rigid bodies do not intersect``, or observations that coarse e.g., that a person is tall, when height in inches is explicit in the model; or even complex logical combinations.
Conditioning on a predicates remains severely limited due to intractable likelihoods.
Our contribution, which we call predicate exchange, 
constructs a softened predicate which takes value in the unit interval [0, 1] as opposed to a simply true or false. Intuitively, 1 corresponds to true, and a high value (such as 0.999) corresponds to "nearly true" as determined by a distance metric.
We define Boolean algebra for soft predicates,  such that they can be negated, conjoined and disjoined arbitrarily.
A softened predicate can serve as a tractable proxy to a likelihood function for approximate posterior inference.
However, we target exact inference by tempering the relaxation by a temperature parameter, and use replica exchange Markov Chain Mont Carlo, which exchanges states between a sequence of models conditioned on predicates at varying temperatures, and in doing so is able to draw exact samples from the unrelaxed model.
We describe a lightweight implementation of predicate exchange that it provides a language independent layer that can be implemented on top of existingn modeling formalisms.
