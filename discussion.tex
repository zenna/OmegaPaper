\section{Discussion}
In this work we expanded the class of predicates that probabilistic models can be conditioned on in practice.

% Control flow remains a challenge, and is related to the path explosion problem in program analysis.
% Various strategies have been developed \cite{cadar2008exe, sen2005cute} to mitigate this, largely for automated tested.
% Future work is to explore the extent to which these concepts can be adapted to the probabilistic domain.

% There are several inference strategies other than replica exchange MCMC that could be constructed onto of a relaxed predicate.
% Maximum posterior inference is the most immediate option, which would entail maximizing equation \ref{}.

% Black-box inference methods have gained significant traction due to how general, flexible, a vs grey box
