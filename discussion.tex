\section{Discussion}
In this work we expanded the class of predicates that probabilistic models can be conditioned on in practice.

Problems of this form appear in all forms of program analysis.
This problem is called the path explosion problem, since the number of possible paths often increases combinatorially with program size and runtime length.
Automated program testing, which is concerned with finding program paths that yield to failure has developed various strategies \cite{cadar2008exe, sen2005cute}.
% Broadly, these trace the execution of the program and derive in symbol form the branch constraints.
% These constraints are solved to force the execution into branches of the program that incur error states.
% These tools have been scaled to very large problems, in complex real world code.
% Two methods that use heuristics toguide path exploration are [4] (which attempts to explore paths that hit less-often executed statements.
Unlike automated testing, probabilistic inference has the stricter requirement of adhering to the true posterior distribution.
However, in predicate exchange, we have a latitude on all nonunitary values.
This opens up the potential for extending program analysis methods to the probabilistic domain in future work.

% The objective of this contribution is to expand the class of predicates that probabilistic models can be effectively conditioned on

% Our methodology falls broadly within the domain of approximate bayesian computation, in the sense that we equip spaces with a distance metric.
% At a high level, this can be understood as extracting more information out of a predicate, which unmodified provides only 0 or 1, which is insufficiently informative for any inference procedure to exploit.
% By an large, inference in high-dimensional models has been restricted to fininte dimensional continous models.
% This remains the case for our method, methods discrete models remain a challenge

% Control flow remains a challenging problem, for fundamental reasons.


% There are several inference strategies other than replica exchange MCMC that could be constructed onto of a relaxed predicate.
% Maximum posterior inference is the most immediate option, which would entail maximizing equation \ref{}.

% Black-box inference methods have gained significant traction due to how general, flexible, a vs grey box
