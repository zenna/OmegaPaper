\section{Discussion}
In this work we expanded the class of predicates that probabilistic models can be conditioned on in practice.
This pushes predicates exchange into the domain of constraint solvers.
Precisely which kinds of predicates are suitable for relaxation in practice remains an open question.

Equality conditions on continuous variables indicate sets of zero measure.
This is problematic because the probability of proposing a satisfying state in a Markov chain becomes zero.
In these cases predicate exchange samples at a minimum temperature greater than zero, which is approximate.

The problem of unexplored program paths due to control flow is related to the path explosion problem in program analysis \cite{cadar2008exe, sen2005cute}.
Future work is to adapt program analysis solutions to this problem.


Hard predicates provide a single bit of information.
Predicate relaxation effectively increases the quantity of information available to inference procedures to a real value.
We anticipate that continuing to extract more kinds of information from models could lead to novel sampling methods.


% There are several inference strategies other than replica exchange MCMC that could exploit predicate relaxation.
% Maximum posterior inference is the most immediate option, which entails maximizing Equation \ref{fpm}.

% Black-box inference methods have gained significant traction due to how general, flexible, a vs grey box
