\section{Discussion}
In this work we expanded the class of predicates that probabilistic models can be conditioned on in practice.
% The objective of this contribution is to expand the class of predicates that probabilistic models can be effectively conditioned on

% Our methodology falls broadly within the domain of approximate bayesian computation, in the sense that we equip spaces with a distance metric.
% At a high level, this can be understood as extracting more information out of a predicate, which unmodified provides only 0 or 1, which is insufficiently informative for any inference procedure to exploit.
% By an large, inference in high-dimensional models has been restricted to fininte dimensional continous models.
% This remains the case for our method, methods discrete models remain a challenge

% Control flow remains a challenging problem, for fundamental reasons.


% There are several inference strategies other than replica exchange MCMC that could be constructed onto of a relaxed predicate.
% Maximum posterior inference is the most immediate option, which would entail maximizing equation \ref{}.

% Black-box inference methods have gained significant traction due to how general, flexible, a vs grey box
