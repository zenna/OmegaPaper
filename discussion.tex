\section{Discussion}
In this work we expanded the class of predicates that probabilistic models can be conditioned on in practice.
This pushes predicates more into the domain of constraint solves.
However, it remains difficult to delineate which predicates are amenable to our method.
% In future work, we intend to characterise this 

Equality conditions on continuous variables indicate sets of zero measure.
This is problematic because the probability of proposing a satisfying state in a Markov chain becomes zero.
In these cases predicate exchange must sample at a minimum temperature strictly greater than zero, which is approximate.

Hard predicates provide a single bit of information.
Predicate relaxation effectively increases the quantity of information available to inference procedures to a single real value.
% Future research is to extend this further, possibly by providing a candidate change that 

Control flow remains a challenge, and is related to the path explosion problem in program analysis \cite{cadar2008exe, sen2005cute}.
Future work is to adapt program analysis solutions to this problem.

% There are several inference strategies other than replica exchange MCMC that could exploit predicate relaxation.
% Maximum posterior inference is the most immediate option, which entails maximizing Equation \ref{fpm}.

% Black-box inference methods have gained significant traction due to how general, flexible, a vs grey box
