\section{RNN for Glucose Model}
\label{app:glucose-code}
Model to create a recurrent neural network to predict the glucose trajectories of a patient. The first patient is conditioned on the full trajectory of $20$ steps, while the second patient is conditioned only on $3$ time steps. In addition to the condition on data, simulations are conditioned to be closed on their first and second moments.
